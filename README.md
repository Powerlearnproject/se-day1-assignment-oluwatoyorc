Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering systematically applies engineering principles, methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality software systems.
importance of software engineering is scalability, cost efficiency, quality and reliability, innovation and dn competitiveness 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Google in 1998 by Larry Page. NATO software engineering in 1968. Programming languages in 1950s such as COBOL in 1959 by Grace Hopper. BASIC in 1964 by John Kemeny and Thomas Kurtz, etc

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
design-this is setting up a software. Development-interprete problem into computer based language and create a solution. testing-test the type of solution in relation to the problem. deployment-rolling out solutions to others. maintenance-update software with new features

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Comparison: Waterfall methodology is predictive while Agile methodology is adaptive and iterative.
Contrast: Waterfall methodology is suitable for well-defined and stable requirements while Agile methodology is suitable for uncertain changing or complex requirements 
Scenario: Waterfall methodology can develop a simple e-commerce website and Agile methodology can create mobile applications with frequent software feature updates

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer: designs, develops and test software applications. Quality Assurance Engineer: participates in continuous improvement initiatives to enhance testing processes.
Project Manager: leads and coordinates software development projects from initiation to its delivery 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): use to improve code quality and readability. Example ks visual studio 
Version Control Systems (VCS): use to roll back changes when needed. 

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Complexity and it can be overcome by breaking down complex problems into smaller tasks
Time management and this can be overcome by balancing tasks and deadline
Communication: can be overcome by practising active listening and clear communication among team or stakeholders 
Troubleshooting: can be overcome by implementing automated testing and monitoring 

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing ensures individual components work correctly, reducing errors and bugs
Integrated testing: is working together and reducing errors.
System testing: is to test the entire system as a whole to be sure it works as expected and is reliable.
Acceptance testing:is verifying the software meets the business requirements


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of getting accurate and relevant responses from AI model via chatbots or other machine learning systems. It's importance is: improves accuracy, increased efficiency, enhanced user experience, mitigation of errors

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Write a birthday message to an older brother who has been a source of inspiration and role model
